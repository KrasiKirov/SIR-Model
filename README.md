# SIR-Model
This is a report project done in Python at Dawson College. Its objective is to see how different factors, such as vaccination, mortality and reinfection can influence disease transmission in a community. Here are two examples of how a change in the rate of vaccination, mortality or reinfection can change the way a disease evolves in a community.
